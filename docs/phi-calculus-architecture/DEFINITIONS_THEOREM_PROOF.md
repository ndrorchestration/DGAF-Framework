## Preamble

This document formalizes the mathematical substrate of the DGAF-Framework governance model. It defines the state space, drift functional, compliance algebra, and fixed-point convergence guarantee that together ensure bounded, auditable multi-agent governance behavior.

> **HDFS 1.0 Requirement:** All definitions must satisfy crystalline clarity — zero ambiguity, fully formal, no informal shortcuts.

---

## Definition 1 — Agent State Space

Let **S** be a complete lattice where each element `s ∈ S` represents an agent's governance state vector:

```
S = (V, ≤)
```

where `V` is the set of all valid governance state vectors and `≤` is the partial order defined by component-wise compliance scoring.

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Confirm lattice completeness — every subset must have a least upper bound and greatest lower bound.

---

## Definition 2 — Drift Functional

The **drift functional** `Δ: S × S → ℝ≥0` measures divergence between an agent's current state `s_t` and its canonical attractor state `s*`:

```
Δ(s_t, s*) = ||s_t - s*||_φ
```

where `||·||_φ` is the phi-harmonic norm weighted by the golden ratio φ = 1.61803…

Drift is considered **critical** when `Δ(s_t, s*) > θ` where `θ = 0.009` (≤ 0.9% governance failure rate).

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Verify θ calibration method — confirm empirical basis for 0.009 threshold.

---

## Definition 3 — Compliance Operator

The **compliance operator** `Γ: S → S` applies the governance policy set `P` to transform a non-compliant state toward the attractor:

```
Γ(s) = argmin_{s' ∈ S} [ Δ(s', s*) + λ · cost(s, s') ]
```

where `λ` is the regularization coefficient balancing correction strength against transition cost.

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Confirm operator truth table — verify Γ is monotone (order-preserving) on `(S, ≤)`.

---

## Definition 4 — Compliance Algebra

The **compliance algebra** `(S, ⊕, ⊗, Γ, 0_S, 1_S)` is defined as:

- `⊕` (join): least upper bound in the lattice — models policy union
- `⊗` (meet): greatest lower bound in the lattice — models policy intersection
- `Γ`: compliance operator (Definition 3)
- `0_S`: bottom element (fully non-compliant state)
- `1_S`: top element (fully compliant attractor state)

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Verify operator truth table for `⊕` and `⊗` — confirm distributive lattice properties hold.

---

## Definition 5 — H-Neuron Suppression Gate

An **H-Neuron suppression gate** `H: S → {0, 1}` is a binary classifier that flags states with hallucination-associated activation patterns:

```
H(s) = 1  iff  activation_pattern(s) ∈ H_set
H(s) = 0  otherwise
```

When `H(s) = 1`, the governance system triggers a mandatory Axiom 1 Guard pass before any state transition is committed.

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Confirm H_set definition is operationally bounded — must not produce false positives on legitimate governance_clear inputs.

---

## Definition 6 — Axiom 1 Connectivity Guard

The **Axiom 1 Connectivity Guard** is a 4-invariant safety check that must pass before any merge to `main`:

| Invariant | Formal Condition |
|-----------|------------------|
| Mathematical Coherence | `∀ proof P in doc: P is internally consistent` |
| Epistemic Honesty | `∀ claim C: ∃ source(C) in reference set` |
| Non-violation of Rights | `∀ data D: D ∩ PII = ∅ ∧ GDPR_Art22(D) = compliant` |
| Global Invariance (HDFS 1.0) | `crystalline_clarity(doc) = TRUE` |

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Run all 4 invariant checks. Log PASS/FAIL per invariant inline.

---

## Definition 7 — φ Attractor Fixed Point

The **φ attractor** `s* ∈ S` is the unique fixed point of the compliance operator `Γ`:

```
Γ(s*) = s*
```

The attractor is anchored at φ = 1.61818 in the phi-harmonic norm space, encoding the golden-ratio-weighted governance equilibrium.

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Confirm uniqueness of fixed point — verify no secondary attractors exist in the defined lattice.

---

## Theorem 1 — Tarski Convergence and Safety Guarantee

**Statement:**  
For any initial agent state `s_0 ∈ S`, repeated application of the monotone compliance operator `Γ` converges to the unique fixed point `s*` in finite steps:

```
∃ n ∈ ℕ : Γⁿ(s_0) = s*
```

Furthermore, at convergence, drift is bounded below the critical threshold:

```
Δ(s*, s*) = 0 < θ
```

**Proof Sketch:**  

1. `S` is a complete lattice (Definition 1) ✓  
2. `Γ` is monotone on `(S, ≤)` (Definition 3, to be verified by Prof Prodigy) ⟳  
3. By the Knaster–Tarski fixed-point theorem: every monotone function on a complete lattice has a fixed point ✓  
4. Uniqueness follows from the strict contractivity of `Γ` under the phi-harmonic norm (Definition 2) ⟳  
5. Convergence in finite steps follows from the bounded depth of the lattice `S` ⟳  

> **Prof Prodigy Verification Note:** [ ] Validate steps 2, 4, 5. Confirm strict contractivity claim. Attach verification attestation JSON.

## Open Questions (Flagged for Prof Prodigy)

1. **θ calibration**: Is 0.009 empirically derived or analytically justified? Source required for HDFS 1.0 compliance.
2. **Lattice depth**: What is the bounded depth of `S`? Required to guarantee finite convergence in Theorem 1 step 5.
3. **H_set definition**: Where is the operational H-Neuron set defined? Needs pointer to implementation.
4. **λ coefficient**: How is the regularization coefficient λ (Definition 3) set in practice? Needs calibration note.
